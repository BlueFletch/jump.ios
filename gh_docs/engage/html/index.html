<div class="contents">
<p><a href="http://TODO">The Janrain Engage for iOS SDK</a> makes it easy to include third party authentication and social sharing in your iPhone or iPad applications. This Objective-C library includes the same key features as our web version, as well as additional features created specifically for the mobile platform. With as few as three lines of code, you can authenticate your users with their accounts on Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, etc., and they can immediately publish their activities to multiple social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Yahoo, through one simple interface.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you need to have created a <a href="https://rpxnow.com/signup_createapp_plus">Janrain Engage application</a>, which you can do on <a href="http://rpxnow.com">http://rpxnow.com</a></p>
<p>For an overview of how the library works and how you can take advantage of the library's features, please see the <a href="http://TODO">Overview</a> section of our documentation.</p>
<p>To begin using the SDK, please see the <a href="http://TODO">Engage for iOS guide</a>.</p>
<p>For more detailed documentation of the library's API, you can use the <a href="http://TODO">JREngage API</a> or <a href="http://TODO">JRCapture API</a> documentation. </p>
